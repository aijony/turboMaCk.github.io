<h2>Hello!</h2>


<p>
  My name is Marek Fajkus. I was born in 1990 in Brno, Czech Republic, where I also currently live again.
  I'm writing software mostly for web even it isn't the only area I'm interested in.
  Currently I'm working for London based company [GlobalWebIndex](https://globalwebindex.net) as a part of team
  responsible for flagship product - both frontend single-page application and JSON APIs.
  I'm interested in functional programming, security and programming languages in general.
  I also enjoy studing and solving non-trivial problems. I like music, beer and freedom.
